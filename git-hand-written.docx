Create repo
git status
git init => it will be hide sometime to see that folder in vs code =>ctrl+, it will open search module after that search =>files.exclude 
After that do =>**/.git TO =>**/.git false


GIT ADD
To add files in git you need a files in out side of git folder and inside in main folder like you make folder with name of first and in that you initialise git so you need to create files (which you wanna add in git) in first folder for essay access.
=>git add one.html one.css
=>git status
TO REMOVE FILE
=>git rm –cached one.css


GIT COMMIT
When you make changes to files in your working directory and then stage them (using git add), git commit saves a snapshot of those staged changes in your local repository. This snapshot becomes a new entry in your project's commit history, with a unique ID.
=>git commit -m “any message”
=>git status




GIT LOG
=>git log
=>git log –oneline 
Its use for see content in one line


GIT CHANGE CODE EDITOR
Because git by default use Vim .
To change vs code as git code editor do this step.
=>open vs code ⇒ ctrl+shift+p 
Try to search =>command:install ‘code’ command in PATH
OR YOU CAN DIRECTLY USE THIS CODE IN VS CODE TERMINAL 
=>git config --global core.editor "code --wait"


GIT KEEP
Its file with name .gitkeep 
Its uses like we create two folder with name image and log now we need log folder never be empty or image folder can be empty so we need make a .gitkeep file in log folder so when we run git status cmd it will not return error in image folder but it will return error in log folder only when its empty. 
GIT IGNORE
This file is used like there’s some files in the project which we dont need or dont want to upload in git so for that we use the .gitignore file. In this file we need to define the file names which we don't want to upload and after that we need to add a .gitignore file and also need to commit a .gitignore file.

GIT PUSH

To push the repo in git we need github account.
Goto git hub click on this icon 
.
To add repo. Give name to repo and scroll down
Copy this paste into vs terminal .
=>git remote add origin https://github.com/Nikk333/first.git
=>git remote -v  
This is to check connection is open or not with remote if all things are okay than it will return this.

For push you must have branch or files .
=>git push -u origin mainbranch
This code is used for only one time to connect with remote branch and repo to github.
After this you need to do add and commit the files.
=>git add myfile.html
=>git commit -m myfile.html
=>git push 
And all set you can go to github and check that repo is added or not.
